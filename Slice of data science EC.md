My reaction to this week’s Slice of Data Science from Clare was quite astounding. As a business analytics major, we are given sets of data that for the most part has already been analyzed. We then use this data and then develop a strategy to solve the problem. I was astounded when I saw the work that Clare was doing from data science, in all the various factors. I also wish I took machine learning at this point because I found it intriguing all the capabilities of machine learning. 

​        I also really enjoyed listening about the neural networks, I took a class in the business school where we would draw neural networks but that was about it. We never really spoke about the complexity behind it or even the capabilities behind it. I thought it was really cool how you could predict the kind of music people enjoy to listen to by using data outside of vocals. Some factors being, danceability, energy, and valence. 

​        Realistically I did not understand much that was spoken about during the slice of data science lecture from Clare, however if there was one thing I could change, I would have done a data science minor, or maybe even a double major. I think having a better background in data science which I do enjoy would have built my resume and made me more valuable. I think it is important to understand where the data came from before just using the end result to make a diagnosis.
