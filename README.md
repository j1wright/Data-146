**Introduction**

Hi I'm Jason, a senior at The College of William and Mary, I'm a business analytics major with a data science emphasis. I enjoy taking classes 
in the data science department because it helps me get a unique perspective of data science outside of the business school. I am also a thrower on the track and field 
team with my event being the hammer throw.
